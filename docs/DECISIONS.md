# Decision log

This file records confirmed decisions. Unvalidated ideas remain in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` or `TODO.md`.

## Recording decisions

Each entry includes a date, status, decision, and rationale. Valid statuses are `Proposed`, `Accepted`, and `Superseded`.

Hard-to-reverse technical decisions with real trade-offs belong in `docs/adr/` and are linked from this log.

## 2026-07-10 — Make gardening history the core value

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Prioritize recording and retrieving plant-care history. Reminders and future guidance support the journal rather than replace it.

**Rationale:** Historical records are the founding product need and the data foundation for later assistance.

## 2026-07-10 — Defer technology selection

**Status:** Superseded by the 2026-07-11 decision

**Decision:** Initially defer framework, database, cloud, and release-platform choices until the main user journey and offline needs are understood.

**Rationale:** Early technology choices would have relied on untested assumptions.

## 2026-07-11 — Select the mobile stack

**Status:** Accepted

**Decision:** Use Expo, React Native, TypeScript, Expo Router, Supabase, TanStack Query, React Hook Form, and Zod. Use feature-first organization and local-first persistence with SQLite.

**Rationale:** The chosen stack supports mobile delivery, runtime validation, clear state ownership, offline entry, and Supabase-backed auth, Postgres, Storage, and synchronization.
